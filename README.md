# Head Pose Estimation using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to estimate the pose of a human head (yaw, pitch, and roll angles) from an input image or video frame using supervised machine learning algorithms. Head pose estimation has various applications including human-computer interaction, gaze detection, and facial recognition.

## Description
This project utilizes Mediapipe to extract facial features and then employs supervised machine learning algorithms to train the model for head pose estimation. No deep learning techniques are used in this project.

## Features
- Utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms for head pose estimation.
- Supports both image and video input.
- Provides visualization of the estimated head pose overlaid on the input image or video frame.
- Customizable to work with different datasets and environments.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
